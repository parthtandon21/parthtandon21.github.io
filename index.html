								<p>Good food does not mean the costly food. The food which is helpful for our body, mind and health and which helps to prevent all the diseases from our body is considered as good food. Generally, a balanced diet contains all elements of food-carbohydrate, protein, fat, vitamin, mineral salt and water. We cannot avoid eating food because it gives us energy and the nutritional requirements we need to survive. Despite the many types of food available for us to enjoy, we should still remember to eat mostly fruits and vegetables because these are the only foods that have high nutritious importance.</p>
